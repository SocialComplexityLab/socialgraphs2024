    "1. **You don't know anything about Python, only have a bit of experience**. Then read this whole thing carefully and follow the advice in Part 3 carefully.\n",
    "2. **You have a bit of experience with Python, but feel like you need a refresher**. Then go through this notebook, chill a bit with the video, and make sure that you can do everything asked of you in the exercises at the end of Part 2. Then you're good to go.\n",

    "## Wait, what about Large Language Models!?!\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "So a series of questions you might have at this point is: \"What about the language models? I know that they can write code really well, so can't I just rely on those? Do I really need to learn Python in this day and age?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To be honest, I'm not quite sure about the answers to these questions (it might very well be than in a few years, we'll just be coding in plaintext via an LLM), but here are some thoughts that are relevant for 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, writing code is a path to understanding the world. By taking a complicated real-world problem and breaking it down into parts that are meaningful for a computer to solve, you're actually doing a key part of the problem-solving process. So learning how to code is important for this simple purpose: It will make you a better thinker, a better problem solver.\n",
    "* Second, the LLMs still make mistakes. And if you can't code, you can't fix those mistakes. This is something I've seen happen a lot: Students getting stuck with a big chunk of LLM-generated code that just looks like a big pile of gibberish to them ... and that they don't how to fix. If that happens, you're *really* stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary, I still recommend you build at least a rudimentary understanding of coding in Python**. Then you can use your LLM as a personal-TA to help you figure stuff out (e.g. instead of stack overflow), or to speed you when solving problems (in a kind of GitHub Copilot scenario ... but that still works better if you're a good coder).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "PS. Note that moving forward I'll use the convention of a blue/turquise box, when I write about LLMs. That's because we're still figuring out how to use them as part of teaching.\n"
